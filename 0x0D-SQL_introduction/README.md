SQL Introduction in Python
Comments (inline or independently) will always begin with #/-- and a space before the string literals
For creation we need to check if entity does not exist, and for deletion, we need to check if entity exists, to avoid SQL errors
When inserting, one will need a new insert for every row and the values must match exactly the records created during creation
